export const aboutMe = "When I was younger, I remember when I first had an enlightening moment when I realized every problem could be solved if you can break them down into smaller and more manageable problems. It's much easier to correctly apply logic to solve a small problem than than trying to logically solve a problem using a macro view. Learning to code quickly intrigued my fascination in which I could do essentially just that, but for virtually any task."

export const aboutMeAlt = "I started my journey into software development about 5 years ago. I completed a Bachelor's in Computer Science at FUI in December 2022 and I have since been building software and contributing to projects. I have gained a ton of experience while thoroughly understanding programming and software life cycle concepts, specifically in React and React Native where I spent the majority of my time.\n\nAside from programming, in my free time I enjoy working out, playing basketball, creating and editing videos, playing chess, and hanging out with my pup."
export const aboutMe2 = 'I completed a Bachelor\'s in Computer Science at FUI in 2022, and immediately began focusing on gaining experience in building software. I created web and mobile applications in Javascript using React and React Native. I focused on making the applications scalable and efficient. The experience has given me the opportunity to familiarize myself with the software developmental life cycle process from planning and design to deployment and maintenance.'

export const aboutMeUpdated = "Hi there! I am a recent Computer Science graduate and a motivated web/mobile developer. My portfolio consists of several projects that I have built from the ground up, handling everything from design to deployment and testing. In every project, my goal is to turn ideas into reality through clean, scalable code which translates efficiently into intuitive user experiences.\n\nThrough my experience since graduating, I got the chance to work with artificial intelligence by incorporating the OpenAI API into several of my projects. I learned to craft prompts that deliver useful, accurate and personalized responses. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing basketball, playing chess, editing videos, or spending quality time with my 10-year-old Rottweiler, Hera."
